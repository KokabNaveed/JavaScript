// this is how to write output 

console.log("Hello World"); // semi-colon is optional but good practice to write it 

console.log("I am Kokab trying to learn JS");


console.log(2,5);

name ="Kokab";
age =23;

console.log("My name is", name ,"and i am",age,"years old."); 

//comma put a space by defualt
// the output is
// My name is Kokab and i am 23 years old.
